This is a collection of basic hardware support libraries for Atmel's AVR series of microcontrollers. They are designed to be easy to use and simple to understand so that they can also serve as examples of how many of the AVR's hardware features can be utilized.

All libraries are designed to be used in an AVR GCC >=4.3 with AVR-LIBC environment. They may work with other compilers or libraries, but this has not been tested.
